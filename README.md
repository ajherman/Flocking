Some projects:

1) Figure out what causes the cool chain reaction thing
2) Make more natural flocking simulations
3)Add vectors to a more smooth animation of the good exploding flock
4)the flock definitly form some kind of pseudo lattice before they explode ( infact I feel like the better the explosion the more pronounced), explore that. In particular draw some edges for flock members in close proximity.
