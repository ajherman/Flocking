This is the devolopment branch.  This is the only branch that should ever be merged to master.  Do not merge broken versions to this branch.  Only merge this branch to master when it has be thoroughly tested.

Some projects:

1) Re-implement using tensorflow
2) Put animate() into a separate file [and general make things more modular]
3) Figure out what causes the cool chain reaction thing
4) Make more natural flocking simulations

                                :)
