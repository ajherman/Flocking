Only merge a new feature to this branch when you have finished working on it.  Only merge this branch to master when you have tested it with the new feature.

Some projects:

1) Re-implement using tensorflow
2) Put animate() into a separate file [and general make things more modular]
3) Figure out what causes the cool chain reaction thing
4) Make more natural flocking simulations
